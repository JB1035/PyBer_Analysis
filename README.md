# PyBer_Anlysis

## Overview 
The CEO of a ride-sharing app has requested an analysis of 5 months worth of data. The goal is to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. After working through summary statistics chart plotting, and regression models to ensure no variables are overly skewed, the focus of the analysis is now on three key city types: urban, rural and suburban.
