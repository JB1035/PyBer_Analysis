# PyBer_Anlysis

## Overview 
The CEO of a ride-sharing app has requested an analysis of 5 months worth of data. The goal is to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. After working through summary statistics chart plotting, and regression models to ensure no variables are overly skewed, the focus of the analysis is now on three key city types: urban, rural and suburban.

## Resources
* Pyber_ride_data.csv
* city_data.csv
* ride_data.csv
* SoftwarePython 3.7.13, Jupyter Notebook

## Summary
* Peak months are similar across each city type except for suburban areas in the summer in comparison to rurual.
* Urban areas generate the most revenue with a higher return on fare per ride than fare per driver, showing more profitability. Maintain that equilibriam.
* Suburban areas generate the second most revenue, but at nearly half of Urban due to less rides and drivers. Adding more drivers could increase profitability.
* Rural areas generate the least revenue at nearly less than a half of total rides and drivers. Adding more drivers could increase profitability.
